It would be tempting to eliminate the 12 direct blocks in the inode, thus
saving 12 * sizeof uint. However, the main bottleneck in disk I/O is disk I/O
itself. Moreover, althought disk cache exists, it's below the inode layer.

Therefore, one major advantage of this imbalanced direct + indirect arrangement
of inode blocks is to reduce the number of block I/Os.
